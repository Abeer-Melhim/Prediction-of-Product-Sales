 key visuals and insights


countplot for outlet type:

This count plot shows that:

1.supermarket_1 has the the most outlets

2.supermarket_2,grocery store, and supermarket_3 has fewer outlets

Explanation of the Plot:

This is a Histogram that shows the distribution of Item_Outlet_Sales values. It represents the number of occurrences (count) of different sales amounts.

Key Insights

The distribution is right-skewed, meaning most sales values are concentrated on the lower end (closer to zero), while fewer items have very high sales.

The highest frequency occurs for lower sales values, with the number of items sold decreasing as sales amounts increase.

Application of This Analysis

The skewed nature suggests that most items have low sales, while only a few items generate very high revenue.

This insight can help in inventory planning, pricing strategies, and promotions, focusing on ways to boost lower-performing items' sales.
